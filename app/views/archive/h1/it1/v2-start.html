      <p class="govuk-body">We'll ask you about:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>travelling from place to place</li>
        <li>shopping for essential items</li>
        <li>doing the housework</li>
        <li>going to medical appointments</li>
        <li>going to work</li>
        <li>preparing meals</li>
        <li>budgeting</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>We know talking about your health condition may be difficult, but we need you to tell us as much as you can. This will help us make the right decision on your claim.
