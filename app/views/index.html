      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">September 2023: Redesign health information gather</h2>


      <p>Team Lark work within the PIP Service Design team and are currently focusing on redesigning the health information gather (formerly known as the PIP2).</p>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Problem statement</h3>

      <p>The way we gain knowledge on how a citizen’s condition affects them does not reliably enable good decision making. We routinely need to undertake follow-ups throughout the journey, and this lengthens and complicates successfully being able to assess the citizen’s capabilities and needs. The citizen's experience of the information gather is frequently lengthy, difficult to complete and traumatic.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prototypes</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Hypothesis 1</h3>

      <p>We've seen that citizens find the application journey complex, repetitive and don't understand what information to provide.
      </p>

      <p>We think this is because the questions are framed around conditions and daily living and mobility activities.
      </p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      <p><strong>If:</strong> we ask questions around real life day-to-day activities</p>
      <p><strong>Then:</strong> Claimants will be able to complete applications quicker, easier and with less distress</p>

          </h3>
          <p>We've seen: Citizens struggle to give the right type or amount of evidence</p>
          <p>We think this is because: DWP don't allow the citizen to choose how they provide evidence</p>
          <p>So if we: Allow the citizen to choose how they supply their evidence</p>
          <p>We'll see: The process will be less stressful for the citizen</p>
